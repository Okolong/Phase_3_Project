# SyriaTel Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Analysis
## Business Understanding 
This project focuses on predicting and analysing customer churn using a dataset from SyriaTel telecommunications company. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers likely to leave, enabling them to make decisions that will lead to retention of more customers. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results.
### Problem Statement 
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service provider). Identifying such customers beforehand allows the company to implement targeted interventions to retain them.

### Project Goal 

- Analyse the dataset to understand the churning trends

- Train multiple classification models

- Evaluate and compare models using various performance metrics

- Identify the most influential features driving churn.

- Provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

### Models Used

- Logistic regression

- Decision tree

- Natural forest

### Expected Outcomes 

- A robust predictive model that performs well.

- Clear feature importance rankings to guide stakeholders in understanding key drivers of customer churning.

- A scalable solution that can be integrated into existing systems to reduce customer churning.
